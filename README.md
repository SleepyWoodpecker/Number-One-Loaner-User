# Number-One-Loaner-User

The mobile user app in the number one store project used to facilitate loan requests, especially ad-hoc ones.

Made with the MERN stack.

A mirrored version of the app can be found at: https://number-one-user-mirror.onrender.com (I'm using the free service so the server will take a while to start up. Do refresh the page if you are still greeted by a blank screen after 5 mins)
